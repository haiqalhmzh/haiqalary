<p>I have worked at a fast food restaurant called McDonald's for 2 weeks. This is to find some pocket money for me when I start my studies at Universiti Teknologi Mara Kampus Rembau. I also work as a freelance photographer for weddings and events. I only do my freelance photography on the weekends or sometimes on weekdays. I also work as a promoter for an app called Jom Parking. I only worked as a promoter for one month.</p>
